# Player Points UI Display for FiveM

This script provides a user interface (UI) for displaying the current number of player points at the top of the screen in the FiveM game environment. Points are earned based on the speed of the player's vehicle, with higher speeds yielding more points. Additionally, points are reset when the vehicle comes to a stop.

## How it Works

The script continuously monitors the speed of the player's vehicle. When the speed exceeds 70 km/h, the player starts earning points. The faster the vehicle moves, the more points are accumulated. However, when the vehicle comes to a complete stop, the player's points are reset to zero.
